"2321305","ELEMENTS Chapter 1 - Water",,,"We’re launching Elements, a new monthly night on the first Thursday of every month. Each night revolves around a different element and we’re opening with Chapter 1: Water. 

This one’s all about pure fun: house music, colour, and a transformed space that feels a bit like a mini-festival. We're bringing that festival feeling indoors.
For the first chapter we’re turning one of Edinburgh’s newest venues into an underwater utopia! Blue tones, immersive projection, custom artwork and design. Just enough atmosphere to make this night special.
DRESS CODE: Wear something blue... a tee, shades, anything to help the room feel more connected! It doesn't have to be crazy but we reward those who go all out and want to dress up. 
Music on the night comes from Macka, a familiar name across Scotland’s house scene with sets from Sub Club and Cab Vol to Fly Open Air, Fly Ibiza. Macka comes off a sold-out London show, and has picked up support from Pete Tong, Ewan McVicar and Dam Swindle.

Over a 30-year+ career, she has scaled the heights of dance music fame and hedonism playing disco, house and techno to huge crowds and in cool underground basements. She is a dj who is renowned for consistently ‘smashing’ every set she plays. One of two women to have a regular monthly residency at the Hacienda, she went on to have residencies at Heaven and Ministry of Sound, before serving successful stints in Paris and Ibiza.

"2335684","Shampain – Millenium Madness Tour",,,"In the wake of his debut electronic album Millenium Madness, Galway DJ/Producer Shampain brings the sweaty circus that is the Millenium Madness tour on the road. Blending the weird, the mad and the wonderful - the tour will take place in selected intimate venues across the UK & Ireland, with a unique twist for each show, delivering a special experience to every city. 

Shampain is a Galway-born DJ and producer whose eclectic sets fuse ambient, bass-driven, club and cinematic elements. With more than a decade behind the decks, he has earned a reputation as one of the rare touring DJs whose path is built not on releases, but on a colorful music library, flawless mixing, and a distinctive persona. Now a key figure in Ireland's underground scene, Shampain continues to push boundaries with his unique sonic style. Shampain co-founded both VSN and G TOWN Records. He also directs the DIY operations at FREAK Magazine; an exciting art and music platform celebrating the weird and wonderful of the audio and visual worlds. Across his first two releases he has worked with acclaimed Irish artists Julie Dawson (Of Newdad) and Elaine Malone, along with underground icons Bethany and Rachel Trench.

MANTUA is an experimental music project by Elaine Malone (pôt-pot/GEIS). Influenced by environmental decline, symbolism in the form of Virgin Mary holograms and the decay of nature. Mantua's third album ‘Galtee Vitual Muse’ released on Fort Evil Fruit is rooted in psychedelia, shoegaze and dream pop, but with a more lo-fi approach, delving into murkier subterranean depths. 

‘There’s an instinctive rawness to Malone’s meditations on loss and longing, summoned with gusts of distorted guitar, quivering drones and metronomic drum machines.’ - Anois Os Ard

The main floor will kick off at 22:00 with resident Dj PsyUbik, who’ll be playing a proggy set for the early dancers. The portal will open at midnight with a set by SwampStomp. We are happy to have Clavey for the first time playing her tribal proggy followed by a surprise act.

"2346781","Fangs: Manuel Darquart",,,"Manuel Darquart returns to Edinburgh, carrying a long and loved connection to the city through shared dancefloors with Jacuzzi General. A long-standing pal and trusted collaborator, Manuel Darquart’s relationship with the city runs deep, rooted in late nights, mutual respect and a shared love for records that favour feeling over formula.

Known for a sound that drifts between hazy, psychedelic textures and Europe-leaning disco warmth, his selections and productions carry a sense of freedom and back alley Ibizan romance, equal parts cosmic and grounded. With releases on Wolf Music Recordings and a catalogue that includes Keep It DXy, Birds of Paradiso EP and The Del Sol EP, Louie has been building a well-earned reputation for music that is generous, emotional and deeply danceable.",18,"7","/events/2346781",,"2026-02-14T00:00:00.000","2026-02-14T23:00:00.000","2026-02-15T03:00:00.000",9,"<artist id=""84754"">Manuel Darquart</artist>

"2342845","♱ 1 Year of Nightcore Rave ♱ Bongo Club ♱ Fri 20 Feb ♱",,,"༺ 𝖓𝖎𝖌𝖍𝖙𝖈𝖔𝖗𝖊 𝖗𝖆𝖛𝖊 ༻
One year ago we took a gamble on running Scotland’s first ever Nightcore Rave, thanks to your support we’re back celebrating its first birthday <3

Big love to all who came to last year's instalments, the fact we are able to run these niche subculture-focused parties is owed to you! After many requests it’s back on the 20th at Bongo to provide another dose ft. even more OG nightcore classix!

A genre whose humble beginnings started simply as sped-up pop songs with anime pictures as cover art, nightcore has since become one of the most influential aesthetics in recent years. Since its genesis in the early 2000s, artists like Fallen Shrine, S3RL, and labels like Nightcore for Total Sluts have developed the style into a genre in its own right.

What started as a celebration of niche internet microgenres is fast becoming the subcultural hub for Edinburgh’s alternative club scene and accelerated digital aesthetics ✰

Get ready for a night of pitch-shifted vocals and high BPMs celebrating the true Y2K10 aesthetic. Expect Happy Hardcore, Kandicore, Trance, J-Core, Kawaii Future Bass, Hyperpop and of course Nightcore.

Early entry tickets are limited and will sell out. At midnight, one hour after doors open, they will expire and be re-allocated for OTD entry, so arriving well ahead of time is advised to beat queues. We recommend coming at 11pm to be safe. If late, please don’t argue with door staff and hold up the queue. We want to get you in as quick and safely as possible!
All Night Entry tickets are available to guarantee entry regardless of arrival time.

Think all things Dark Disco, Synthwave and EBM - so crack your eyeliner out!

Ascetic Practices is a contemporary goth collective run by @the_nightlark, @m0th.girl, @coryrotter and @philomenahhh. Each party they throw oozes with attitude and doubles up as a release party for their exclusive fanzine.

Nina Stanger is an interdisciplinary artist, designer and DJ based in Aberdeen, famous for her eclectic sets (earning her an RA mix of the day and a Boiler Room set), and that time Michael Gove wandered into her DJing 

This party is in aid of LGBT Youth Scotland

"2331167","AVIATE presents: Hayley Zalassi",,,"AVIATE returns to blair street for its second clubnight, continuing the project’s aviation-inspired approach to club culture, built around movement, energy and carefully navigated dancefloor journeys.

Presented by DJ Planespotter, the night sees him bringing his aviation-tinged house sound back to the vaults, guiding the room through warm, rolling selections before handing over to the glasgow's rising star Hayley Zalassi. 
B2B opening duties come from edinburgh local legends KEJO and KEGG, setting the initial altitude with groove-focused house and deep house.

Hayley Zalassi, whose sound spans house, deep house and disco, blending soulful energy with infectious rhythm and dancefloor-ready momentum, a natural fit for AVIATE’s cabin crew.

A night designed for lift-off, cruising and late-night descent, set inside one of Edinburgh’s most iconic underground spaces.

Her sets feel like immersive rituals - shadowy atmospheres, driving percussion, and that slow-build intensity that pulls you deeper with every transition.

Originally from Rome and now embedded in London’s underground, Livid’s sound is fluid, magnetic, and unmistakably her own. Through her residency with Snooze, she’s been carving out a sonic identity built on consistency, depth, and an unwavering commitment to the craft, guiding dancefloors into deep, transformative states.

She’s promising us what EPiKA is about - some serious techno!

Do not miss this one!

SPECIAL GUEST - LOVE IS BLIND

For years, London-based Love is Blind has been quietly shaping soundtracks for others. Operating behind the scenes, she’s been a driving force behind several indie record labels, curating, crafting and championing independent music.

Now stepping fully into the booth, she brings one simple rule: love songs only - romantic, dramatic, messy and made for dancing. Her groove-led, energetic sets celebrate love’s chaos - and encourages the occasional poor decision on the dancefloor.

A selector who takes love seriously enough to dance to it, but not seriously enough to behave.

LIKE THIS has solidified its place as a cornerstone of Edinburgh's underground scene over the past three and a half years. Digging from the rich history of dance music and cutting-edge sounds of today. Residents Lee Marvin, Jimmy Jammin' (Main Ingredient), and Marti-Time! (Unstable Creations) have cultivated a loyal following through their intimate monthly gatherings in Edinburgh Playing the diverse Festval scene and their international gigs in Berlin, Ibiza, Switzerland and beyond. Drawing inspiration from the iconic sounds of Chicago, Detroit, Berlin, New York and London.

LIKE THIS posses a profound understanding of dance floors. Their parties are a masterclass in musical curation: Raw and unfiltered beats with forward-thinking sounds that transcend eras. Each event is a journey back to a time before genres, evoking the spirit of the original underground parties in basements, garages, lofts, and warehouses where dance music culture was born. With an ever-evolving selection of fresh tracks from around the globe, LIKE THIS continues to push boundaries, creating an experience that is both current and deeply rooted in the essence of dance music history.",18,"£5, £10","/events/2337574",,"2026-02-21T00:00:00.000","2026-02-21T23:00:00.000","2026-02-22T03:00:00.000",20,"LOVE IS BLIND

"2346243","Live and In-store: Natasha Kitty Katt",,,"Umbrella Vinyl is thrilled to welcome the return of Natasha Kitty Katt to celebrate the release of her vinyl EP 'Cybernetique'.
Released in the twilight of 2025 on her own label, Shadowrunner Records, 'Cybernetique' features two dancefloor-ready powerhouses — 'Cybernetique' and 'Neural Net' by the influential Edinburgh DJ and producer who's re-defining disco-house culture through a series of electrifying underground releases.
Forged in the flicker of a dystopian cityscape, these tracks pulse with the lifeblood of Neo Noir — driving synth basslines, hypnotic arpeggios, and relentless electronic rhythms built for late-night floors and strobe-lit basements.
On side A, 'Cybernetique' captures the tension of a future metropolis in motion — mechanical, seductive, and cinematic.
'Neural Net', on the flip, dives deeper into the circuitry, weaving emotion and machine in perfect sync.
Together, they form a twin narrative of dark euphoria and synthetic soul.
Nastasha will be in-store to greet fans and talk about her music Of course, we'll make sure she gets behind the decks to spin some vinyl from her collection.",,"£0","/events/2346243",,"2026-02-21T00:00:00.000","2026-02-21T16:00:00.000","2026-02-21T18:00:00.000",0,"<artist id=""57940"">Natasha Kitty Katt</artist>",false,false,,false,"2026-01-14T02:49:50.530Z",false,true,"[{""id"":""2438598"",""filename"":""https://images.ra.co/0771e68537dc65113c03ca81ccc4b00b51fa0f98.jpg"",""alt"":null,""type"":""FLYERFRONT"",""crop"":null}]","{""id"":""275534"",""name"":""Umbrella Vinyl"",""address"":""20 Valleyfield St, Edinburgh EH3 9LR"",""contentUrl"":""/clubs/275534"",""live"":true,""area"":{""id"":""341"",""name"":""Edinburgh"",""urlName"":""edinburgh"",""country"":{""id"":""3"",""name"":""United Kingdom"",""urlCode"":""UK"",""isoCode"":""GBR""}},""location"":{""latitude"":0,""longitude"":0}}","[]","[{""id"":""57940"",""name"":""Natasha Kitty Katt"",""contentUrl"":""/dj/natashakittykatt"",""urlSafeName"":""natashakittykatt""}]",,"[]","[]","{""id"":""10454666"",""username"":""LaraS-RA""}","[]","[]","[]","[]","[{""id"":""21"",""name"":""Disco"",""slug"":""disco""}]","{""id"":null,""lineup"":null,""status"":""NONE""}","{""ianaTimeZone"":""Europe/London""}","LEGACY",

"2352617","Alien Disko: Tanukichi (Night On Earth / RAM Records / Undergroundtekno)",,,"Alien Disko returns to our residency at the Bongo Club on Friday 27th February with our first international booking of the year: the legendary Tanukichi!

Tanukichi is a Japanese DJ who’s always willing to evolve and to experiment at the frontiers of sound, in order to craft original tunes that strike powerful chords with his audience.

He has been into Europe’s free party culture since 2006, after a life-changing Teknival experience in his home country. Since then, he has been producing music that perfectly fits this scene’s vibe. Over the years he became one of the faces of European Hardtek, as well as being a trait d’union between Japanese and European rave scenes.

Tanukichi’s vivacious sound, centered on powerful kick drums, big bass and steady rhythms, all matched with a pristine and flawless sound production, moves and contaminates the audience’s spirit in a chain of energy and entertainment.

He is currently trying to achieve an high-powered sound with 4 kicks and a 175 BPM pace, pioneering the next era of drum and bass, energising people and making them dance, feel, and fly on the high spirits of the kick bass, as has always been the case in Tanukichi’s 18 years long music career.

Tanukichi consistently performs at major festivals across Europe and Japan.
Among others, he has played: Boomtown Festival and Glastonbury in the UK, Fujirock in Japan, Defqon.1 Festival in the Netherlands, Electrobotik Invasion and  Reperkusound in France, Selvatek in Spain, Beats For Love Festival and X-Massacre in Czech Republic.

As a producer who's music is always a staple of our residents USBs, we are very excited to have Tanukichi for his Bongo headline debut! 

Joining Tanukichi in the booth we're delighted to announce that we have Jigsore's Karl Radox and Brockout's duo Rhythm Session venturing up north, who will be spanning 140-165bpm Acid, Jungle, and Breaks. Alien Disko residents will be completing the roster with our signature multi-genre style.

Legendary Edinburgh tropical party starters Samedia Shebeen join forces with street music promoters and educators Oi Musica for a very special one-off celebration in the heart of Portobello where both outfits are based.

Jamz Supernova (BBC 6music / DJ Set)
Jamz Supernova uses sonics to tell a story. The multi-faceted creative force is a label head, radio host, DJ, podcaster, and true tastemaker, broadcasting for over a decade. Known for her slots on BBC Radio 1Xtra (Best Specialist Aria Gold Winner 2021), BBC 6Music (Broadcast & Press Guild Best radio show of 2022) & Selector Radio for the British Council, reaching over 4 million global listeners. She is an avid explorer, collector and promoter of diverse worldwide sounds and frequently travels the globe to connect and understand musical movements at their source. As a DJ she weaves these thread together with style and skill and plenty of attitude to make a great dancefloor experience for all.

El Buho (Shike Shika / Live)
Robin Perkins aka El Búho was born in the rolling hills of northern England but found his musical home in the forests, rivers & mountains of Latin America. His sound marries his influence of Dub, IDM and Electronica with the rhythms, traditions and melodies of Latin American folk and the organic sound of waterfalls, birdsongs and crackling leaves. The result is a dreamy, deep, melodic journey that entrances as much through headphones as it does on the dancefloor.

His breakthrough EP Cenotes, written whilst living in Mexico and featuring the track Mañana Tepotzlan, was released in 2015 via Wonderwheel Recordings and was followed in 2017 by his debut album Balance to critical acclaim as one of the the leading names in the emerging organic electronic scene. 

Alongside his music, El Búho is also an environmental activist, having worked for over eight years at Greenpeace, being a member of DJs For Climate Action and coordinating the non-profit project “A Guide to the Birdsong” a series of albums that raise funds and awareness for endangered bird species through electronic music. In 2020 he also participated in the New York Times author Ian Urbina’s project The Outlaw Ocean, creating a four track EP inspired by the ocean deep and the need to protect this mysterious, beautiful and fragile ecosystem from threats like oil drilling.

Oi Musica (Live)
Oi Musica creates visceral live performances using rhythm, percussion and brass. Their music is all about building energy and blurring the lines between audience and performer. They'll be debuting a brand new project with live brass & percussion, fat electronics and plenty of vibe! Drawing inspiration from global street band music, Oi Musica is guaranteed to bring the energy of hot dusty streets at carnival time right into the heart of the dance floor. Don’t miss the debut of Oi Musica’s freshest new act…

Samedia DJs
This crew have been rocking dancefloors across the UK and beyond for over 15 years with their exciting fusions of world and global club sounds. Known locally for their annual Solsctice Beach Party and long-running residency at the Mash House.

North Fire Soundsystem
Providing the bass, mids and tops all the way from Cumbria - one of the top soundsystems on the scene and long time collaborator with Samedia at Knockengorroch, Boomtown and beyond.

Join us as Berlin’s Session Victim arrive in the Scottish capital for a very special live appearance on Saturday 28 February.

Renowned for pushing boundaries within house and electronic music, Session Victim describe themselves, with typical understatement, as a “Two Man House Band”. It’s an fitting title given their sound is rich, warm, deeply musical and built on feeling and meaninful groove.

Hauke Freer and Matthias Reiling are widely regarded as one of the most accomplished house duos of their generation. Their catalogue includes three genre-defining triple LPs on UK tastemaker label Delusions of Grandeur, alongside the critically acclaimed Needledrop album for Night Time Stories: a release praised for its depth, musicality and reverence for dancefloor culture. Add to this over twenty vinyl-only EPs and a string of modern classics for labels such as Rhythm Section, Retreat and Pen & Paper, and their influence becomes difficult to overstate.

As performers, there are very few modern house acts who havee logged as much meaningful club time as our February guests. For nearly two decades now, the Berlin-based duo have been quietly - and sometimes not so quietly - left their mark on dancefloors across the globe, from sweat-soaked basements to some of the most respected clubs and festivals in electronic music (think Panaroma Bar, Fabric, De School, Corsica to name but a few!).

It’s this extensive, hard-earned road experience that gives Session Victim their unmistakable confidence behind the machines they use.

Don't miss this rare opportunity to catch them live in an indepdent club setting. Tickets on sale now!

We have been following Edward around the world for the past 6 years and he has always blown us away with his amazing sound.

After his groundbreaking set at Houghton and honoured as one of the best sets at Houghton, we thought it’s about time we brought through the German legend to showcase his unique and amazing sound for the first time in Scotland. 

This is a very rare and special occasion to catch this legend on Scottish Soil.

"2355725","feeo (live) at Pianodrome",,,"AD93 signee feeo comes to the Pianodrome on March 6th, touring her new album Goodness.

'One of the most breathtakingly beautiful albums of the year.' - Pitchfork

Feeo is the solo project of Theodora Laird, emerging from the London experimental improvisation scene. It's easy to get lost in Goodness' dense and cold soundscapes-- the album is a peculiar and tremendously compelling combination the Copenhagen sound-dream, girded with a real immersive dread, reminiscent of F# A# Infinity at full pelt.

Every track is a highlight, but pay particular attention to 'win!'. The simple refrain of 'we can figure this out' is manipulated endlessly by Laird's shapeshifting voice; taking on new meanings with each dip, pause and elongation of the phrase. It feels like a memory of a dub song, the drums breaking through from time to time but firmly outside of the song; sounds are processed until they're unrecognisable then buzz around like insects. Finally, there's a moment of air before it all collapses into muffled bass.

Since the Album's release in October it has been subject to a steady stream of praise: Achieving #6 on Pitchfork's electronic albums of the year, DJ Mag's top albums of 2025 and the Guardian's best new tracks along with countless glowing reviews in publications across the music world.

Support comes from Daksh.

Whether you’re coming solo or with your crew, we’ll get you moving, laughing, and glowing all day long!

Early Bouncer: £7.50
General Admission: £10

Regular Drum n Bounce classes are currently running on Mondays at Bellfield from 5pm and QMU Sports Centre from 7.30pm. We'd love to have you along for a regular bounce, so come join the movement!

Whether he's dropping underground classics on Blawan & Pariah's label Voam, Nervous Horizon, Numbers or Joy O's label Hinge Finger, or working with Björk, Fever Ray and Smerz, no one does it quite like Peder. He's been pulling about dancefloors for the best part of 20 years with his own brand of non-conformist bass and techno, splitting the difference between playful immediacy and daring experimentation.

More recently, his PM+ series and Peder Mannerfelt Produktion label has seen him thrive on the energy and community of contemporary club music, pushing the music’s possibilities in wild, unpredictable directions.

"2310076","Jitwam (DJ set): Free Time",,,"Shaped by over a decade of moving through London, NYC, and Australia, Jitwam’s soulful music has always resisted borders. 

The Indian-born creative has long been known for nomadically fusing psychedelic soul, jazz, and house into spiritually charged records. Since his debut “TJD001” in 2013, Jitwam quickly gained respect from tastemakers like Gilles Peterson and Moodymann, who included the EP’s  “Keepyourbusinesstoyourself” in the now iconic DJ-Kicks compilation; a move that sparked international attention and set Jitwam on a global trajectory. 

With a creative process that is both intentional and intuitive, he released his self-titled debut album, ज़ितम सिहँ, in 2017. This was followed by several EPs on his own imprint, The Jazz Diaries, and full-length albums Honeycomb (2019) and Third (2022). With over 100 million streams to date, Honeycomb remains a defining release in Jitwam’s catalogue. 

Jitwam stands, as always, as a rare connective tissue between club rhythms and spiritual introspection. All part of his lived experience, his forthcoming project ""ALLIN"" project draws equal parts from classic soul, Indian cinema, lounge jazz, and Detroit house, a music community he holds a profound affinity for.",18,"","/events/2310076",,"2026-03-15T00:00:00.000","2026-03-15T18:00:00.000","2026-03-15T22:00:00.000",56,"<artist id=""73691"">Jitwam</artist>",true,false,"2026-02-04T11:51:21.650Z",false,"2025-11-20T15:54:25.103Z",false,true,"[{""id"":""2460956"",""filename"":""https://images.ra.co/1c57a40c51c9793d5212d4da14da63e0906694f0.png"",""alt"":null,""type"":""FLYERFRONT"",""crop"":null}]","{""id"":""13319"",""name"":""Sneaky Pete's"",""address"":""73 Cowgate; Edinburgh, EH1 1JW; Scotland; United Kingdom"",""contentUrl"":""/clubs/13319"",""live"":true,""area"":{""id"":""341"",""name"":""Edinburgh"",""urlName"":""edinburgh"",""country"":{""id"":""3"",""name"":""United Kingdom"",""urlCode"":""UK"",""isoCode"":""GBR""}},""location"":{""latitude"":55.948195,""longitude"":-3.191494}}","[{""id"":""46141"",""name"":""Sneaks Events"",""contentUrl"":""/promoters/46141"",""live"":true,""hasTicketAccess"":true,""tracking"":[{""id"":""3281"",""code"":""350181965415645"",""event"":""FacebookPageView""},{""id"":""3283"",""code"":""4010875002575808"",""event"":""FacebookPageView""}]},{""id"":""161174"",""name"":""Free Time Days"",""contentUrl"":""/promoters/161174"",""live"":true,""hasTicketAccess"":false,""tracking"":[]}]","[{""id"":""73691"",""name"":""Jitwam"",""contentUrl"":""/dj/jitwam-us"",""urlSafeName"":""jitwam-us""}]",,"[]","[]","{""id"":""1062676"",""username"":""sneakypetes""}","[{""id"":""1195110"",""title"":""Early bird (£6.90 + fee)"",""validType"":""SOLDOUT"",""onSaleFrom"":""2025-11-20T15:30:00.000Z"",""priceRetail"":8,""isAddOn"":false,""currency"":{""id"":""1"",""code"":""GBP""}},{""id"":""1195111"",""title"":""General admission (£10.80 + fee)"",""validType"":""VALID"",""onSaleFrom"":""2025-11-20T15:30:00.000Z"",""priceRetail"":12.5,""isAddOn"":false,""currency"":{""id"":""1"",""code"":""GBP""}},{""id"":""1195112"",""title"":""Final release (£14.30 + fee)"",""validType"":""VALID"",""onSaleFrom"":""2025-11-20T15:30:00.000Z"",""priceRetail"":16.5,""isAddOn"":false,""currency"":{""id"":""1"",""code"":""GBP""}}]","[{""id"":""1195110"",""validType"":""SOLDOUT""},{""id"":""1195111"",""validType"":""VALID""},{""id"":""1195112"",""validType"":""VALID""}]","[{""id"":""434009"",""sourceId"":""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-pJt_4BSdA&pp=ygUGaml0d2Ft"",""audioService"":{""id"":""8"",""name"":""Full Media Url""}}]","[]","[{""id"":""6"",""name"":""House"",""slug"":""house""},{""id"":""29"",""name"":""Jazz"",""slug"":""jazz""}]","{""id"":null,""lineup"":null,""status"":""NONE""}","{""ianaTimeZone"":""Europe/London""}","LEGACY",

"2337006","Deep Excursions (Daytime): Maurice Fulton",,,"Excited to welcome the supremely talented Maurice Fulton from Tokyo for the 2nd daytime instalment following the very lively & well received launch party with Linkwood & Craig Smith in December.

Originally from the port city of Baltimore in the U.S., he is widely regarded as one of house music's true originals with a back catalogue of highly sophisticated productions. A somewhat elusive character, his musical foundations run deep — shaped by disco, funk, soul and early hip-hop before becoming synonymous with house music in the early 90’s. As an extremely accomplished DJ, his sound is very much influenced by his background with his sets moving freely between house, disco, techno and left-field selections.

The intimate People's Leisure Club basement is the ideal setting to showcase his talents. 

Also excited to welcome Atjazz Record Company affiliated 'Peacey' to the lineup. In addition to being an all round top lad, he is, like Maurice Fulton, an extremely talented producer with a very impressive back catalogue of original productions and remixes whilst also being equally at home on the decks as he is in the studio.

Expect deepness and when it comes to Maurice Fulton, definitely expect the unexpected!

Maurice Fulton Bio

Maverick production genius Maurice Fulton is a man of few words, who is more inclined to let his music do the talking. We know for certain that he comes from Baltimore in the USA and has been DJing since his early teens. Starting on Hip-hop and then moving on to House and Garage at various residencies across the US he played under his nickname DR Scratch.

Maurice began playing organ in church and drums in high school. So when he put his talent to making music it wasn’t long before he was using his skills to produce tracks with The Basement Boys and Ultra Nate. His most famous work was heard on Gypsy Woman by Crystal Waters, one of the most successful house tunes of the early ‘90s.

Maurice went on to become highly prolific in his production work releasing tracks on various labels through the 90’s including Nuphonic and Warp in the UK. Often linked to contemporaries like Carl Craig, Derrick May and Frankie Knuckles, his textured sounds and complexity of production astounded many and grew him a loyal fan base. Some called it weird house others arty disco, his left of centre productions were always on the money.

In his more recent years he has been working for Tirk, Kathy Diamond and DFA. Maurice likes to be known first and foremost as a producer, though for those in the know, Maurice is also an extremely accomplished DJ. His sets are firmly routed in the Loft and Garage classics that gave New York City its clubbing heritage. These tracks often quietly edited to perfection by his own hand, and presented and eq’ed to maximum effect on the dance floor.

Maurice Fulton is one of house music’s true originals and his enviable back catalogue will live long in a modern world of disposable downloads.

As the world crossed into the new millennium, the sound of House evolved. For Chapter 2, we are moving from the raw roots of the 90s into the digital revolution and genre-bending energy of the 2000s. We aren't just looking for the superclub anthems; we are digging for the Electro-clash cuts, the French Touch gems, and the early Tech House records that redefined the dancefloor.

The Liquid Room was born in the 90s, but we grew up in the 00s. This was the decade where our walls soaked up the sweat of a changing scene. By bringing Temporal into this era, we are revisiting the nights that solidified our legacy as an Edinburgh institution.

Expect top-tier DJs and Selectors delving deep into the depths of your temporal lobe to bring the distinct, driving sound of 00s House back to the forefront.",18,"2","/events/2323032",,"2026-03-28T00:00:00.000","2026-03-28T23:00:00.000","2026-03-29T03:00:00.000",39,"<artist id=""102213"">Macka</artist>

"2328025","Theo Kottis ⥊ Good Coll B2B Hobbes ⥊ DRUMA ⥊ Club Cadence  ⥊ Club_Nacht ⥊ Hobbes Music",,,"This March, we’re delighted to welcome DJ, producer and long-time Rinse FM resident Theo Kottis back to Edinburgh, as he plays The Bongo Club for the very first time.

You’d have to be living under a rock not to know Theo. One of Scotland’s brightest exports, he’s long been a mainstay of the UK electronic music circuit and a trusted presence behind the decks, playing clubs and festivals across Europe. Despite his international reach, he remains deeply connected to the city’s club culture, regularly appearing at some of Edinburgh’s most respected parties.

Kicking off his DJ career at just eighteen, we first met Theo when he was throwing parties and co-running the electronic music–influenced clothing brand We Own alongside Marty Bell (Poolsuite) and Tom Ketley (Fly Open Air). Momentum built quickly: from grassroots parties across Scotland, the trio went on to bring BBC Radio 1’s Pete Tong to a sold-out Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre, before Theo secured a coveted main-stage slot at RockNess - Scotland’s largest festival after T in the Park - all within the space of a year.

Fast forward fifteen years and Theo has gone from strength to strength, taking his sound worldwide and playing clubs and festivals across Europe and beyond - from intimate basement rooms to major stages. Along the way, he’s amassed millions of streams through a steady run of releases on labels including Dekmantel, Fabric, FUSE, CWPT, Moda Black and Permanent Vacation, alongside remixes for artists such as Sasha, Goldfrapp, Joe Goddard (Hot Chip) and Shadow Child. 

Never fixed to one side, Kottis' sound has evolved, while remaining underground and consistently ahead of the curve. ",18,"£0-12","/events/2328025",,"2026-03-28T00:00:00.000","2026-03-28T23:00:00.000","2026-03-29T03:00:00.000",42,"RM 1:

"2270119","Roni Size x LTJ Bukem",,,"Two absolute legends in the game, LTJ Bukem and Roni Size, join forces for a double headline show of mind-blowing drum ‘n’ bass.

Emerging out of the late 80’s as a DJ, LTJ Bukem discovered his passion for drum and bass when exploring the realms of jazz fusion. So it’s natural that when Bukem’s career as a DJ progressed in the early 90‘s and he found himself delving in to the studio, it was these frantic breakbeats in tandem with the melodic, yet almost awry bass lines of jazz instrumentation that informed Bukem’s creations, developing a progressive and textured sound equal parts anthemic and tranquil. The album was titled ‘Logical Progression’ and marked Bukem as an innovator, a tag that has stuck through his work on his own esteemed Good Looking Records imprint, and still bears strong today as Bukem continues to DJ extensively across the globe

Bristol native Roni Size is one of the U.K. jungle scene’s most respected names, with production credits spanning dozens of labels, projects, and releases. Although not as quick to rise to acclaim (either critical or popular) as peers such as Goldie or LTJ Bukem, Size’s influence as a producer, label owner, and committed underground magnate figured him as one of the emerging sound’s true pioneers. The breakout success of his debut album New Forms (including Britain’s prestigious Mercury Award) finally confirmed his stature and vaulted him to a greater degree of popularity than any other drum ’n’ bass producer.

Marking two epic days in the Scottish capital alongside 40,000 ravers and six fully immersive indoor and outdoor stages, the weekend is set to shake the foundations of Edinburgh's Royal Highland & Showground thanks to its diverse lineup which spans the spectrum of techno & beyond. Think new faces, fast rising talent and returning favourites.

Over 100 artists from every corner of the globe will be touching down in Edinburgh for the momentous occasion. Every stage will offer it's own standalone world, with bespoke architecture, mind-bending visuals and chest-rattling sound for a sensory experience built for those who live and breathe dance music.

Sara Landry brings the UK debut of her ETERNALISM show, her only Scottish appearance all year, while the likes of Klangkuenstler brings his unmistakable schranz sound back to the country for the first time since 2022 - a rare UK appearance.

Also joining the lineup is I Hate Models who marks a highly anticipated return alongside the likes of Clara Cuvé, Ben Hemsley, Robert Hood, Novah, Fantasm, Santøs, Patrick Mason, Vieze Asbak, East End Dubs, Patrick Topping, Mall Grab, Morgan Seatree, Klofama + MANY more.

Full day and stage splits have now been revealed for the festival. Each stage is designed with a clear purpose, allowing different parts of the electronic spectrum to exist without compromise, from peak-time headline techno to foundational house, from high-pressure intensity to emerging local voices.
 
Alongside a multi-faceted lineup and the addition of an extra 6th stage, a landmark £1 million investment into site development and production upgrades is in place for 2026. Following feedback, this is a transformative step designed to elevate every aspect of the festival experience. These improvements will roll out across all stages, facilities and audience areas and underpin Terminal V’s continued rise as one of Europe’s leading large-scale electronic music festivals. 

Consistently ranked among DJ Mag’s Best Festivals in the World, Terminal V continues to evolve at a pace matched only by the scene itself, which is why 40,000 people from all over the world travel in numbers to the festival.

"2328032","Hobbes Music 13th Birthday: Michelle Manetti ⥊ Mairi B b2b Hobbes + many more ⥊ Club_Nacht",,,"Join us this April as Hobbes Music marks 13 years in the game. We’re celebrating properly at The Bongo Club, with special guest and label alumnus Michelle Manetti.

DJ, vocalist, producer and promoter Michelle Manetti has deep roots in UK club culture. Cutting their teeth as an underage raver in the late 90s, they’ve since become a respected figure in East London’s queer underground, bringing over 20 years of experience behind the decks and a reputation built on consistency, taste and graft rather than hype.

A committed advocate for marginalised and under-represented artists, Michelle is the founder of the FLINTA*-focused party Fèmmme Fraîche at Dalston Superstore, a long-running bi-monthly celebrating 10 years this year, known for safe space, strong line-ups and a genuine sense of community. They’ve also held residencies at The Cause and Adonis, with regular appearances at Horse Meat Disco, Little Gay Brother, Homoelectric, Percolate and beyond.

More recently, Michelle has been working closely with Demi Riquisimo, with releases including the No Given Time EP and the 2023 standout “All I Need”, a track that’s done the rounds and will already feel familiar to many. If it’s not already in your listening pile, now’s the time to fix that. Track below! 

Michelle was also previously the vocalist in cult London trio The Off Key Hat, who released a slew of head-turning records via Andy Blake's legendary vinyl-only label, Dissident (late 00s), including the bona fide club hit, Emergency Calling. MANY moons later, a pair of stellar demos landed at Hobbes Music hq and the label released the killer double A-side single, Shot At Dawn b/w Warm Your Love, in 2018.  

Michelle last visited Bongo when they co-headlined the HM label's 5th birthday with Glasgow's adopted Slovenian star (and fellow HM-alumnus), Nightwave. Suffice to say, Michelle's closing set absolutely tore the roof off the joint and they went on to deliver the goods again the following night at Paradise Palms.  Suffice to say, we've been working on a return date for some time...

Support duties on the night come from HM label boss Hobbes, going back-to-back with Mairi B to mark the label anniversary in proper fashion. Making the trip up from Newcastle, Mairi is one half of label affiliates Accident Machine, as well as a fierce selector in her own right.

Additional support acts are still to be announced, with more names landing soon.",18,"£0-12","/events/2328032",,"2026-04-25T00:00:00.000","2026-04-25T23:00:00.000","2026-04-26T03:00:00.000",6,"RM 1:

"2302548","RIVAL CONSOLES",,,"One of the UK’s most influential creators of electronic music, Rival Consoles, returns with a brand new audio-visual live show, centred around his new album Landscape from Memory — marking a new chapter in an ongoing quest for refinement and evolution.

London-based producer Ryan Lee West, better known under the name Rival Consoles, is notable for making synthesisers sound human and atmospheric. Over the course of a critically acclaimed eighteen-year career, his music has diversified from the challenging electronic output of his early EPs, to gradually becoming more conceptual and metamorphic with his albums.

In July 2025 Rival Consoles released his latest studio album Landscape from Memory on Erased Tapes, and is presenting it with a brand new unique performance that will take the form of an immersive audio-visual experience in which he will present material from across the last 15 years of his career and beyond. From deep ambient works to his unique version of techno, and traversing the vast spectrum in between, the show will be a long-form narrative of ideas — many heard live for the first time — with visuals co-created and performed live by Sky Ainsbury.

"2347884","Max Cooper",,,"Max Cooper is an electronic composer, multi-disciplinary artist, music label founder and former scientist who has carved out a unique space in music and visual art.

 

He holds a PhD in computational biology at the same time as being the first contemporary electronic musician to perform at the ancient Acropolis theatre in Athens and one of the first clutch of musicians to produce in Dolby Atmos.

 

Cooper has enquired for over 15 years through music, collaborations, and his label Mesh, to explore the intersections between the arts and sciences with installations, performances, immersive experiences, online media, music videos and live events. Anchored throughout is his emotive approach, connecting how ideas and forms feel, in a manner accessible to us all.

 

""I've always had a strong emotive bond with aesthetics, and found at an early age that the purified forms of electronic music carried a lot of weight for me, as did the reductive natural aesthetics of the sciences. That felt connection to both opened up a world I've been lost in ever since.""


Pivoting from computational biology to electronic music might not seem like the most natural career transition, but for Cooper the commonalities are obvious:""In both fields, you're in a sense, free. Free from the limits of living systems, free from the limits of corporeal sound. The only constraints are in your mind.""



Max Cooper has collaborated with Zaha Hadid Architects, Dolby, L-Acoustics, 4DSOUND, Barbican Centre, W1 Curates, The Babraham Institute and exhibited work at museums including the Pompidou Metz, ZKM Karlsruhe, Museum Wave Seoul and The Science Museum London.",,"£27 | £25","/events/2347884",,"2026-05-20T00:00:00.000","2026-05-20T19:00:00.000","2026-05-21T22:00:00.000",7,"<artist id=""3641"">Max Cooper</artist>",false,false,"2026-01-15T16:27:07.283Z",false,"2026-01-15T16:27:07.297Z",false,true,"[{""id"":""2440801"",""filename"":""https://images.ra.co/40a25aabf88351604939c11267a000981bef8728.jpg"",""alt"":null,""type"":""FLYERFRONT"",""crop"":null}]","{""id"":""80881"",""name"":""Usher Hall, Edinburgh"",""address"":""Usher Hall, Lothian Road, Edinburgh, EH1 2EA"",""contentUrl"":""/clubs/80881"",""live"":true,""area"":{""id"":""341"",""name"":""Edinburgh"",""urlName"":""edinburgh"",""country"":{""id"":""3"",""name"":""United Kingdom"",""urlCode"":""UK"",""isoCode"":""GBR""}},""location"":{""latitude"":55.9492,""longitude"":-3.206291}}","[]","[{""id"":""3641"",""name"":""Max Cooper"",""contentUrl"":""/dj/maxcooper"",""urlSafeName"":""maxcooper""}]",,"[{""title"":""Culture Edinburgh"",""url"":""https://cultureedinburgh.com/events/max-cooper-""}]","[]","{""id"":""11730273"",""username"":""cultureedinburgh""}","[]","[]","[]","[]","[{""id"":""75"",""name"":""Electronica"",""slug"":""electronica""}]","{""id"":null,""lineup"":null,""status"":""NONE""}","{""ianaTimeZone"":""Europe/London""}","LEGACY",

"2333857","HECT㋡RS 14th Birthday: Special Guest TBA ⥊ Club_Nacht ⥊ Hobbes Music",,,"On Saturday 23rd May, join us as we team up with HECT㋡RS to celebrate 14 years of shindigs, questionable patter, and doing things the hard way… properly.

Running weekly at Cabaret Voltaire for the best part of a decade, HECT㋡RS became a fixture in the lives of many Edinburgh clubbers. Week in, week out, it hosted a serious run of international talent from the ’90s and beyond. Anyone in the know understands that kind of consistency doesn’t come easy - it’s graft - and it’s exactly what cemented HECT㋡RS as one of the city’s top nights.

Support on the night comes from HECT㋡RS mainstay David Elders (MFSB / Delders), alongside Hobbes.

With a big guest still to be announced, we’d recommend getting involved early. Keep your eyes peeled for this one!

------------------------------------------------------------------

DAYS returns to the Granton waterfront this May. We’re heading back to The Pitt Market, taking over the warehouse and yard for our best party to date (hopefully).

We’ve been piecing this lineup together for a while, and the result is a proper cross-section of the sounds we’re into right now. We’ve got the heavyweights covered with Daniel Avery, DJ Seinfeld, and Helena Hauff, while Sweely brings his signature live energy. Rounding things out are Papa Nugs and MarcelDune, two selectors currently at the top of their game.

As always, the local scene is the backbone of the festival. We’ve invited a massive stack of talent from Edinburgh and further afield to make sure the energy is right from the very first set.",18,"£28-62","/events/2267178",,"2026-05-30T00:00:00.000","2026-05-30T13:00:00.000","2026-05-30T22:30:00.000",804,"A-Z Headliners

"2333851","Start Of Summer Shindig: OOFT! ⥊ Ann Tweak ⥊ Hobbes ⥊ Cosmico + more ⥊ Club_Nacht",,,"Summer officially starts here. On Saturday 20th June, ahead of the summer solstice, we’re pleased to welcome back our Start Of Summer Shindig, this time with a very special guest: OOFT!.

A true mainstay of Scotland’s underground for well over a decade, OOFT! (aka Ali Herron) has earned his reputation through consistently strong parties, releases and DJ sets rooted in house, disco, funk and Balearic sounds. A DJ first and foremost, his approach is musical unflashy, and forever in the know.... the kind of selector who knows how exactly to let a record breathe.

As a DJ he has held long-running residencies at some of Glasgow's top venues including theThe Sub Club, The Berkeley Suite and, more recently, weekly Sundays at La Cheetah for his KEEP ON residency with fellow Gtown veteran David Barbarossa. Beyond Glasgow, he’s toured extensively across the UK, Europe and further afield, bringing a sound that comfortably moves from slow-motion Balearic moods through underground disco to classic, soulful house.

In the studio, OOFT! has built a deep and varied catalogue, releasing on respected international labels and carving out a reputation for music that DJs actually play. His 2012 track 'Love & Soulsaving' became something of a modern underground classic moving effortlessly through DJ bags worldwide, clocking up close to three and a half million streams and selling out its vinyl run, copies of which now regularly fetch serious money second-hand.

Since the release of his debut album Intricacies Of Modern Life in 2018, the focus has shifted. While original productions continue, much of his studio time is now spent crafting bespoke edits, reworks and tweaks - tools designed purely for the dancefloor. Many are cut exclusively for his own sets, tested in the moment and never released publicly. It’s this behind-the-scenes graft - the quiet refinement of records you didn’t know you needed - that keeps OOFT! firmly in demand and endlessly trusted behind the decks.
